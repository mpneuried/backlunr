backlunr
===========

is a solution to bring [Backbone Collections](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection) together with the browser fulltext search engine [Lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/).

**INFO: all examples are written in coffee-script**

## Install

To use **backlunr** you first have to load the dependencies:
- [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore) 
- [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) 
- [Lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/)

Then add the `backlunr.js` script to your page.

## Usage

### Config

To use the `lunr.js` fulltext search within a collection you have to load `backlunr.js` and use `Backbone.Collection.Lunr` instead of `Backbone.Collection`

The only thing you have to define are the fields to index.

**Config Example:**

```coffee
class User extends Backbone.Model

class Users extends Backbone.Collection.Lunr
	model: User
	lunroptions: 
		fields: [
			{ name: "firstname", boost: 10 }
			{ name: "lastname", boost: 5 }
			{ name: "email" }
			{ name: "address" }
		]
```

#### lunroptions

* `fields` ( Array | Function ): An array of field definitions or a method called on init/reset which has to return the field definitions array
* `fields[ n ]` ( Object ): The field definition
* `fields[ n ].name` ( String - required ): The field name within your model attribute
* `fields[ n ].boost` ( Number - optional: default=1 ): A boost factor for results in this field.

**Attension:** Currently Lunr.js does not support an indexing of numeric values. To use numeric values **backlunr** converts all fields to strings.

### search

To search within your collection you just have to call `.search( "[ term ]" )`.

**Search Example:**

```coffee
# add some users
usersCollection = new Users [
	firstname: "Fritz", lastname: "Maier", "email": "fmaier@maier.com", "address": "Teststreet 123"
, 
	firstname: "Hans", lastname: "Schubert", "email": "hschubert@maier.com", "address": "Checkway 987"
]

result = usersCollection.search( "Fritz" )
# [ User( Fritz ) ]
# returns an array of matching models sorted by the result scoring

result.toJSON()
# [ {firstname: "Fritz", lastname: "Maier", "email": "fmaier@maier.com", "address": "Teststreet 123"} ]
# the single special method `toJSON` of the array returns all models converted by `model.toJSON()`.
```

### Methods

#### Collection.search( term [, raw ] )

`.search()` is the only method added to the collection by **Backlunr**.

**arguments:**

* `term` ( String - required ): the search term
* `raw` ( Boolean - optional: default=false ): Return the raw lunr result including the `score` and models `cid` as `ref`

**retuns ( Array ):**

An array of matching models.  
If you define `raw=true` you will receive an array with object like `{ score: 0.789, ref: "c123" }`

* `toJSON()` If `raw=false` you can use the special `toJSON` method to transform the aray of models to an array of model attributes.

## Ideas

* Create a solution to search in multiple collections by hooking them to a global search module. If a search has been done the result will return all matching models in al hooked collection including the type ( Collection name )

## Work in progress

`backlunr` is work in progress. Your ideas, suggestions etc. are very welcome.

## Development

If you want to contribute you have to install the dependencies and gulp as task runner:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp
```

After that it's possible to build the code using

```sh
$ gulp
```

## Changelog

#### `0.2.3`

* Fixed Issue #1 to init the collection on search if nor reset has been fired
* Added gulp compile
* Updated test to Lunr.js `v0.5.8`, jquery `v2.1.3`, mocha `v1.21.5` and expect `v0.3.1`. **Backlunr test already working fine*
